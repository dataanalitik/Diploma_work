5 tasks written in Python language were added to the WebUI branch. All tasks were performed in the Pycharm IDE Below will be given instructions for launching and working with the program

For the robots of the program, you need chromedriver.exe. it's in the branch, and the requirements.txt file is attached with the version of the Selenium library that I used

To run, you need to run the Runner.py file

This can be done in this piece of code:

login = 'RT'

password = 'Passw_2022'

name = 'Roman'

country = 'Ukraine'

city = 'Kyiv'

card = '1234 5678 9012 3456'
